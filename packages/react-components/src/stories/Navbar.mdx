  conjunction with the header or elsewhere in your app.

## Usage and resources

The navbar is built into the [Header](/?path=/docs/components-header-header--docs#subnavigation), and can be populated via the `subnavItems` prop. It can also be implemented separately.

## Controls

<Primary of={NavbarStories} />
<Controls of={NavbarStories.NavbarTemplate} />

## Configuration

Navbar expects an array of components passed to the `children` slot. It renders children inside a `<nav>` element, and automatically places a [separator](/docs/utility-separator--docs) between each item.

It is designed to work well with [Link](/docs/utility-link--docs) and [Button](/docs/components-button-button--docs) components.

### Styling

To add additional CSS rules for navigation items, target the `.bcds-Navbar--Container` class.

### Responsive design

Navbar is responsive by design, but you may need to implement additional styling if you have a long list of navigation items, or want to collapse the menu at smaller viewport sizes.
